# Synopsis
A Sanguosha (三国杀) Discord bot built in Python modeled after the mafia-like Sanguosha card game

## Introduction to the Game
Sanguosha is a card game with 4 roles: Emperor (主公), Loyalist (忠诚), Rebel (反贼), and Spy (内间). Each have their own objective, and only the emperor's role is revealed.
Each round, players pick up a card (basic, utility, equipment, or stadium) and decide what to do with them.
